# Palindrome string

Program that checks if a given string is whether a palindrome or not.

To check this instead of check the hole string I do not have to loop over the hole string
but only the first half of it.

We only have one for loop so the complexity of the solution is a O(n)

## Instalation

The class is situated on the package com.myolnir so to compile you execute

`javac -d <where do you want to put the class files>/Palindrome.java`


After a couple of seconds you will have a Palindrome.class in the route you put on the above command.

To execute this class you should run:

`java com.myolnir.Palindrome`

The program should run and ask you for a string, after you enter the script the program returns if
the given string is a palindrome or not.
